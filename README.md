# SABR Model

This project provides an implementation of the **SABER (Stochastic Alpha, Beta, Rho)** modelâ€”a sophisticated stochastic volatility model used in quantitative finance.

The aim is to:
- Simulate the SABR dynamics.
- Analyze the impact of various parameters (e.g., alpha, beta, rho, vol-of-vol) on the **volatility smile**.
- Visualize how changing these parameters distorts or reshapes the implied volatility curve.

This implementation can serve both **educational** and **practical** purposes, allowing researchers and practitioners to better understand model calibration and behavior under different market conditions.
